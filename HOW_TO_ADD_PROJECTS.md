# How to Submit a New Project

**Simple guide for the team — no technical skills needed!**

---

## STEP 1: Create a Project Folder

**Folder name must be:**
- Lowercase letters only
- Use dashes (`-`) instead of spaces
- No special characters (no ., &, ', etc.)

**Examples:**
- "Octavius Tower Caesars Palace" → `octavius-caesars`
- "Park Hyatt Niseko Hanazono" → `park-hyatt-niseko`
- "Grand Hyatt Macau" → `grand-hyatt-macau`
- "The Londoner Macau" → `londoner-macau`

---

## STEP 2: Prepare the Photos

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT — File Format & Naming:

**You can:**
- ✅ Resize, crop, or edit photos as needed
- ✅ Use `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` format

**You must:**
- ✅ Rename the files correctly using numbers only (see below)
- ✅ Use correct file formats (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`)

---

### Photo Requirements

**Minimum: 5 photos** (numbered 0–4)
**Recommended: 7 photos** (numbered 0–6)
**Maximum: Unlimited** (keep numbering: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...)

---

### What Each Photo Should Be

| File Name | What It Shows | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **0** | Exterior building photo | **Portrait preferred** — this is the cover image |
| **1** | Wide landscape banner | Shows at the top of the project page |
| **2** | Real interior photo | Actual installed carpet in the space |
| **3** | Drawing or plan view | Floor plan/drawing of **the same area as photo 2** |
| **4** | Another important interior | Main space, lobby, hallway, etc. |
| **5** | Detail or close-up | Carpet texture, pattern, edge detail |
| **6** | Final main interior or detail | Last key photo |
| **7+** | (Optional) Extra photos | Additional angles, details, or areas |

---

### File Naming Rules

**Numbers only — no letters, no words**

✅ **Correct:**
```
0.jpg
1.png
2.jpg
3.jpg
4.jpg
5.png
6.jpg
```

❌ **Wrong:**
```
exterior.jpg
banner photo.png
photo_2.jpg
IMG_1234.jpg
```

**Rules:**
- Start at 0 (not 1)
- No skipped numbers (0, 1, 2, 3 ✅ / 0, 1, 3, 5 ❌)
- No spaces in file names
- Allowed formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`

## STEP 3: Real Examples from Our Projects

### Example 1: Grand Hyatt Macau (5 photos)
**Folder:** [grand-hyatt-macau](https://github.com/jojoucsd/tccglobaldecor/tree/main/public/images/projects/grand-hyatt-macau)

```
grand-hyatt-macau/
├── 0.avif     ← Building exterior (cover image)
├── 1.avif     ← Wide landscape banner
├── 2.avif     ← Interior with carpet installed
├── 3.avif     ← Floor plan/drawing
└── 4.avif     ← Additional interior detail
```

**Note:** This project has 5 photos, which is the minimum. The website will show Sections A and C.

---

### Example 2: Park Hyatt Niseko (12 photos)
**Folder:** [park-hyatt-niseko](https://github.com/jojoucsd/tccglobaldecor/tree/main/public/images/projects/park-hyatt-niseko)

```
park-hyatt-niseko/
├── 0.avif     ← Building exterior (cover image)
├── 1.avif     ← Wide landscape banner
├── 2.avif     ← Interior with carpet
├── 3.avif     ← Floor plan/drawing
├── 4.avif     ← Main space photo
├── 5.avif     ← Detail shot
├── 6.avif     ← Another interior
├── 7.avif     ← Extra photo
├── 8.avif     ← Extra photo
├── 9.avif     ← Extra photo
├── 10.avif    ← Extra photo
└── 11.avif    ← Extra photo
```

**Note:** This project has 12 photos. Photos 0-6 are used in the layout, and photos 7-11 appear in a carousel at the bottom of the page.

---

## STEP 4: Include Project Details (Optional)

**Note:** This step is optional. Sometimes the photo provider doesn't need to provide project notes and details — that can be handled by the person implementing the project. However, it's very helpful if you can provide this information!

If you have the information, copy and fill out this template:

```
PROJECT NAME: Octavius Tower Caesars Palace
FOLDER NAME: octavius-caesars

ADDRESS:
3570 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109, USA

SUMMARY (2–3 sentences):
A brief overview of the property — its design philosophy, atmosphere,
or unique characteristics.

DESCRIPTION (3–4 sentences):
How TCC Carpets contributed to the project. What did we create? What
techniques or materials were used? How do the carpets enhance the space?

NOTES (optional, 1–2 sentences):
Additional details about patterns, colors, or special features of the
carpet installation.
```

**Real Example:**

```
PROJECT NAME: Park Hyatt Niseko Hanazono
FOLDER NAME: park-hyatt-niseko

ADDRESS:
328-47 Aza Iwaobetsu, Kutchan, Abuta District, Hokkaido, Japan

SUMMARY:
Nestled at the base of Mount Annupuri, the Park Hyatt Niseko Hanazono
celebrates natural beauty through quiet luxury and refined craftsmanship.
The interior design draws inspiration from the surrounding landscape—snow,
wood, and stone.

DESCRIPTION:
Within this context, TCC Carpets designed a series of bespoke floor
coverings that reflect the rhythm of nature and the Japanese aesthetic
of restraint, balancing visual calm with tactile warmth.

NOTES:
Subtle gradations and organic patterns complement wood and stone interiors
across suites and public areas.
```

## STEP 5: Submit Your Project

**Once your project is ready:**

1. Put all photos in a folder with the correct name (lowercase with dashes)
2. Make sure files are named: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, etc. (no skipped numbers)
3. Send it to the web developer by:
   - Uploading to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), OR
   - Emailing as a zip file

**That's it!** The developer will handle the rest.

## 🙌 Reassurance for Non-Technical Users

**You do NOT need to know anything technical!**

**Just:**
- Choose good photos that show the project
- Rename the files correctly (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Put them in a folder with the right name
- Send it to the developer

**That's all!** The developer will handle optimization, conversion, and uploading.

## ❓ Questions?

**Q: What if I don't have a drawing for photo 3?**
A: Use another interior photo instead. But ideally, include a floor plan or technical drawing if available.

**Q: Can I use my phone photos?**
A: Yes! As long as they're clear and well-lit.

**Q: What if I have more than 7 photos?**
A: Great! Keep numbering: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc.

**Q: What if I only have 5 photos?**
A: That's okay — just send what you have (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

**Q: Do the photos need to be a certain size or format?**
A: No specific requirements — `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` formats are fine. The developer will handle final optimization and conversion.
