# How to Submit a New Project

**Simple guide for the team — no technical skills needed!**

---

## STEP 1: Create a Project Folder

**Folder name must be:**
- Lowercase letters only
- Use dashes (`-`) instead of spaces
- No special characters (no ., &, ', etc.)

**Examples:**
- "Octavius Tower Caesars Palace" → `octavius-caesars`
- "Park Hyatt Niseko" → `park-hyatt-niseko`
- "The Londoner Macau" → `londoner-macau`
- "MGM Grand Las Vegas" → `mgm-grand-las-vegas`

---

## STEP 2: Prepare the Photos

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT — What You Need to Do:

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Resize images
- ❌ Convert to different formats
- ❌ Edit or crop photos

**ONLY DO THIS:**
- ✅ Rename the files correctly (see below)

---

### Photo Requirements

**Ideally provide 7 photos** (numbered 0–6)

If you have more, keep going: 7, 8, 9, 10, etc.

---

### What Each Photo Should Be

| File Name | What It Shows | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| **0** | Exterior building photo | **Portrait preferred** — this is the cover image |
| **1** | Wide landscape banner | Shows at the top of the project page |
| **2** | Real interior photo | Actual installed carpet in the space |
| **3** | Drawing or plan view | Floor plan/drawing of **the same area as photo 2** |
| **4** | Another important interior | Main space, lobby, hallway, etc. |
| **5** | Detail or close-up | Carpet texture, pattern, edge detail |
| **6** | Final main interior or detail | Last key photo |
| **7+** | (Optional) Extra photos | Any additional images you want to include |

---

### File Naming Rules

**Numbers only — no letters, no words**

✅ **Correct:**
```
0.jpg
1.png
2.jpg
3.jpg
4.jpg
5.png
6.jpg
```

❌ **Wrong:**
```
exterior.jpg
banner photo.png
photo_2.jpg
```

**Rules:**
- Start at 0 (not 1)
- No skipped numbers (0, 1, 2, 3 ✅ / 0, 1, 3, 5 ❌)
- No spaces in names
- Allowed formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`

---

## STEP 3: Folder Structure Example

Your folder should look like this:

```
octavius-caesars/
├── 0.jpg
├── 1.jpg
├── 2.jpg
├── 3.jpg
├── 4.jpg
├── 5.jpg
├── 6.jpg
├── 7.jpg (optional)
└── 8.jpg (optional)
```

---

## STEP 4: Include Project Details

Copy and fill out this template:

```
PROJECT NAME: Octavius Tower Caesars Palace
FOLDER NAME: octavius-caesars

ADDRESS:
3570 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109, USA

SUMMARY (2–3 sentences):
A brief overview of the property — its design philosophy, atmosphere,
or unique characteristics.

DESCRIPTION (3–4 sentences):
How TCC Carpets contributed to the project. What did we create? What
techniques or materials were used? How do the carpets enhance the space?

NOTES (optional, 1–2 sentences):
Additional details about patterns, colors, or special features of the
carpet installation.
```

**Real Example:**

```
PROJECT NAME: Park Hyatt Niseko Hanazono
FOLDER NAME: park-hyatt-niseko

ADDRESS:
328-47 Aza Iwaobetsu, Kutchan, Abuta District, Hokkaido, Japan

SUMMARY:
Nestled at the base of Mount Annupuri, the Park Hyatt Niseko Hanazono
celebrates natural beauty through quiet luxury and refined craftsmanship.
The interior design draws inspiration from the surrounding landscape—snow,
wood, and stone.

DESCRIPTION:
Within this context, TCC Carpets designed a series of bespoke floor
coverings that reflect the rhythm of nature and the Japanese aesthetic
of restraint, balancing visual calm with tactile warmth.

NOTES:
Subtle gradations and organic patterns complement wood and stone interiors
across suites and public areas.
```

## ❓ Questions?

**Q: What if I don't have a drawing for photo 3?**
A: Use another interior photo instead. But ideally, include a floor plan or technical drawing if available.

**Q: Can I use my phone photos?**
A: Yes! As long as they're clear and well-lit.

**Q: What if I have more than 7 photos?**
A: Great! Keep numbering: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc.

**Q: What if I only have 5 photos?**
A: That's okay — just send what you have (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

**Q: Do the photos need to be a certain size?**
A: No — the developer will handle resizing and optimization.
